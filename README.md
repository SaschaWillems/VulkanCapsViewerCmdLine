# Vulkan Hardware Capability (Viewer) Command Line Utility

**Note:** Work in progress, not production ready yet

This is a headless (command line) application to generate Vulkan implementation reports compatible with https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org.

Unlike the [GUI hardware capability viewer](https://github.com/SaschaWillems/VulkanCapsViewer) this has as little external dependencies (e.g. no Qt) so it can be built and run on a wide variety of platforms.
